# Turtlebot Q Table Learning Course Traversal
Implementing a Q table reinforcement algorithm, in this project a simulated robot was trained in a virtual course. Afterwards, the trained model was transferred to a real robot and guided it around a physical course.

This video directly copares the simulated course to the results achieved on the physical course.
